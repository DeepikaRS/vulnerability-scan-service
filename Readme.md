# Spring Application for File Upload and Vulnerability Scanning

## Overview

This Spring application provides a RESTful API for users to upload dependency files. The files are forwarded to a third-party vulnerability scanning service, and based on the scan results, the application implements a rule engine to evaluate triggers and execute actions such as notifications.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload multiple files via a REST API.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Uploaded files are sent to a third-party API for vulnerability scanning.
- **Rule Engine**: Evaluates scan results against predefined rules and executes actions based on triggers.
- **Notifications**: Sends notifications when certain conditions are met during the scanning process.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring MVC
- Spring Services
- RESTful API
- Java

## Project Structure

- **UploadController**: Handles file uploads via the `/upload` endpoint.
- **ScanService**: Forwards uploaded files to the third-party scanning API.
- **RuleEngine**: Manages and evaluates rules based on scan results.
- **Rule**: Represents individual rules with associated triggers and actions.
- **Trigger and Action Interfaces**: Define the behavior for evaluating triggers and executing actions.
- **Concrete Implementations**: Includes specific trigger and action classes like `VulnerabilitiesFoundTrigger` and `NotificationAction`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### API Usage

**Upload Files**

- **Endpoint**: `/api/upload`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request**:
    - `files`: An array of files to upload.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST -F "files=@path/to/file1" -F "files=@path/to/file2" http://localhost:8080/api/upload
```

### Rule Engine

The rule engine uses triggers to evaluate scan results. For example, if a certain number of vulnerabilities are found, a notification will be sent.

#### Adding New Rules

To add new rules, implement the `Trigger` and `Action` interfaces and register them in the `RuleEngine`.
